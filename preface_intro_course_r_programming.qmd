# RSTUDIO SERVER SETUP

## Setup

- WiFi connection
- included-crab link
- RStudio Server account password reset

## Key messages / Lesson outline

- We're working in an RStudio sever so that everyone is working in the same environment
   - helps with troubleshooting
   - prevents errors 
- Everyone connected to the WiFi?
- Did everyone successful reset their password for their NCEAS RStudio server account? 
   - If not, Camila can help or we can get additional help from Thomas our IT + Hardware guy
   
- **Everyone login to included-crab** the name of our RStudio Server
   - once you've successfully logged in please put up a green sticky
   
- **Let's make our first R Project**
  - An R Project is tied to a directory on your local computer, and makes organizing your work and collaborating with others easier
  - Aka it it bundles all your work within a working directory (we'll come back to what a working directory is in a second)
  - using an R project is a reproducible research best practice
      - consider your current workflow: 
          - how many different software programs do you use? What do you use them for?
          - The power of RStudio and R programming is that you can very likely consolidate your workflow using just R and RStudio.
    
    - **Follow along with me** as I make an R Project and you can always refer to the steps in the green box or ask Camila for help
    
- **Now let's organize our R Project**
